## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
```


```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

I followed the server side rendering approach throughout the project. As expected :) I hope I did this right.

Unfortunately, I could not filter by issue author, I guess I could not create the correct url for this filter.

But I filtered the issues according to their labels and did the sorting operations. I think I completed these on server-side. We can discuss it :) I also learned a lot with this project. Thank you !

Not: After making your label and sort preferences, please press the search icon and the filtering and sorting process will take place.
